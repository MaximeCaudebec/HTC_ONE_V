HTC_ONE_V
=========

This repository is just for optimization tweaks that have been appplied to RythmicROM, as well as our own. I am working
with the latest development called "CyanPrimo" our goal is to strip down everything unecessery to just leave pure andrioid 
jellybean. We are customizing I/O schedulers and build.prop as well as change some busybox settings to allow optimal memory performance.
