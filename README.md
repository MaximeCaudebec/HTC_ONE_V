IOSmooth ROM
=========

This repository is just for optimization tweaks that have been appplied to RythmicROM, as well as our own. I am working
with the latest development called "CyanPrimo/IOSmooth ROM" our goal is to strip down everything unecessery to just leave pure andrioid 
jellybean as a result you are left with a clean,fast ROM. We are customizing I/O schedulers and build.prop as well as changing some busybox settings to allow optimal memory performance.

Of course you can find me on XDA!
