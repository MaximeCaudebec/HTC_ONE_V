About crossbreeder and HTC One V overclocking:
crossbreeders optimally performance with a Deadline SIO and SmartAssV2 CPU governor, the CPU max clock rate as stated on 
qualcomms website for this specific device is 1.4Ghz, a few devices from samsung and HTC with the same processor are
overclocked to 1.5Ghz but 1Ghz-1.4Ghz is recommended. If you live in a very warm enviornment its recommended you do not OC
due to temperature issues/throttling.
